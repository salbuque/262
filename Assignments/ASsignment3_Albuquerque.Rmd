```{r Load Packages}

library(ggplot2)
```

This R markdown will you two functions case_when_IR and Max_runtime to identify the precipitation rate when the max run time (time prior to creating runoff) of an irrigation system is 0. Case_when_IR will use the soil infiltration rate based on soil characteristics to find the   Allowable surface accumulation (inches). Then Max_runtime will identify the precipitation rate when the max run time is 0 given a fixed IR. 

```{r load function and create results table}
#call in auto power function
source("soil_type.R")

#generate samples from distribution 
nsample = 100
speeds = rnorm(mean = 25, sd = 4, n=nsample)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

IR = c(0.2, 0.23, 0.26, 0.3, 0.33, 0.36, 0.4)
ASA = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.35, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6)
```
